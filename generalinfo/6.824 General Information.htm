<p></p><h2>Structure</h2>

<p>6.824 is a core graduate subject with
lectures, labs, a mid-term quiz, a final project, and a final exam.
6.824 is 12 units.  6 EDPs.
</p>

<p>Class meets Tue/Thu 1:00pm to 2:30pm in 32-144.  Most class
meetings will be part lecture and part paper discussion.  You
should read the paper <i>before</i> coming to class, and be prepared
to discuss it. You can find out what paper to read for each meeting in
the <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html">schedule</a>.

</p><p>
We will post a question about each paper 24 hours before
the beginning of class.
Your answer need only be long enough to demonstrate that
you understand the paper; a paragraph or two will usually be enough.
We won't give feedback, but we will glance at your answers to make
sure they make sense, and they will count for part of the
paper discussion grade.

</p><p>6.824 will have a quiz during class in the middle
  of the term, and a final exam during finals week.

</p><p>There are programming labs due every week or two throughout the term.

</p><p>Towards the end of the term you'll undertake a project of your
choice in a team of two or three students. The project must involve
ideas covered in the course. You'll hand in a short project proposal,
have three meetings with course staff to talk about the project,
present a short a demonstration to the whole class, and hand in a
two-page description of your results.

<p></p><h2>Grading</h2>

Grade for this class will be based on: <br>
<ul>
    <li>30% labs (programming assignments)
    </li><li>30% mid-term quiz and final exam
    </li><li>30% project
    </li><li>10% paper discussion participation and paper questions
</li></ul>

You can hand in your lab solutions late, but the total amount of
lateness summed over all the deadlines must not exceed 72 hours. If
you don't hand in an assignment at all, or don't hand it in by the
last day of classes, we'll give the assignment an F. If you hand an
assignment in late, and your total late time (including the late time
for that assignment) exceeds 72 hours, and you hand it in by the last
day of classes, then we'll give it a D or an F depending on whether it
seems to basically work. You can divide up your 72 hours among the
labs however you like; you don't have to ask or tell us. You can only
use the 72 hours for the labs; for example, you cannot use them for
any aspect of the final project. If you want an exception to this
rule, please bring us a letter from a dean.

<hr>

<p></p><h2>Collaboration policy</h2>

<p>
You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments,
except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are
not allowed to look at anyone else's solution (and you're not allowed
to look at solutions from previous years). You may discuss the
assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use
each other's code.

</p><p>
You may discuss the questions for each discussion paper with other
students, but you may not look at other students' answers.  You must
write your answers yourself.
