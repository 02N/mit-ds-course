In looking at the code, it fails this test because it never
checks to make sure that the viewnum that the primary is pinging
with coinsides with the viewnum the viewserver thinks the primary
should have.  At a higher level the test simulates the primary
restarting by having the primary always ping with viewnum 0 --
the server should recognize that the primary should be pinging
with a larger viewnum and then recognize that a viewchange is
necessary.
